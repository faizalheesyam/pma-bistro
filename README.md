==========

> Just an attempt to give PMA a new look. (or at least something that suite my taste)

![Bistro](http://github.com/faizalheesyam/pma-bistro/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

* This theme is based on `pmahomme` (default theme in phpMyAdmin).
* Currently this build is only for `phpMyAdmin 4.0.9`

To install, simply `clone` this project into your `phpMyAdmin/themes/*`

This is a work in progress, hope you can help make it better, thanks!
